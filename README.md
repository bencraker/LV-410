**LV-410 (Jackson Star Mining Colony) Website Project**  
My first solo project to create a simple website as part of my Scrimba Frontend Developer course.  

**About**  
The aim of this task was to independently build a website to showcase our hometown or a place that we are interested in using the things we had leant from the previous lessons and courses. Again, I went with a movie theme and created a website for the Jackson Star Minining Colony on LV-410.

The brief of the project was to create a site that had 3 sections:  
1. Hero (with a background image, heading and a subheading).
2. Activities section (with a title, 3 columns each with an image, heading and a paragraph of text).
3. Tourist guide section. 
  
The rules stated we had to:  
- Build the site from scratch.
- Make use of (Classes, Flexbox, Background Image, Color Palletes)
  
the Stretch Goals were to:  
- Select your own destination.
- Use a different color pallette than the one given.
- Use a google font.
- Utilise :hover somewhere.
- Add a whole new section.
  
**My Thoughts**  
I went on an bit of tangent and probably did more than i needed to0, but i really enhoyed it and am finding that what i am learning is sinking in.

**Built With**
- HTML
- CSS
