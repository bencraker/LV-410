# Jackson Star Mining Colony Website  

My first solo project to create a simple website as part of the Scrimba Frontend Developer course.  

**About**  
The goal of this project was to independently build a website showcasing a place of interest using the skills learned in previous lessons. I chose a movie theme and created a site for the Jackson Star Mining Colony on LV-410.

The project brief required a site with 3 sections:  
1. **Hero** – background image, heading, and subheading  
2. **Activities** – title, 3 columns each with an image, heading, and paragraph  
3. **Tourist Guide**  

Requirements included:  
- Build the site from scratch  
- Use classes, Flexbox, background images, and colour palettes  

**Stretch Goals**  
- Select your own destination  
- Use a custom colour palette  
- Use a Google font  
- Apply `:hover` effects  
- Add an additional section  

## My Thoughts 
I went a bit off-tangent and probably did more than required, but I really enjoyed it and feel like what I’m learning is sinking in.
