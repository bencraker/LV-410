                <h2>About Planet LV-410 & Jackson Star Mining Colony</h2>

                <p>Nestled in the distant Alpheios System, LV-410 is a world of extremes! A rugged, Mars-sized planet rich in untapped potential. Once considered inhospitable, Weyland-Yutani’s pioneering terraforming and atmosphere processing have transformed it into a viable frontier world. With its striking ringed horizon and long twilight cycles, LV-410 offers a haunting beauty that reminds every colonist what it means to push the edge of human expansion.</p>
                <p>Established in 2133, Jackson’s Star stands as a testament to human determination and corporate ingenuity. What began as a remote mining outpost has grown into a thriving colony, supplying iridium, platinum, and rhodium to the Core Systems. Modern habitation domes, automated refineries, and a resilient workforce have made life on LV-410 not just possible, but profitable. For those seeking a fresh start, steady pay, and the promise of purpose among the stars — Jackson’s Star welcomes you home.</p>
